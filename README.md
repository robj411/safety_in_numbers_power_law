This repository accompanies the document Injury_linearity.pdf.

It contains all code and data used to produce the figures therein.

The key questions are:

* Does the observation of "safety in numbers" in road-traffic statistics correspond to a power-law scaling relationship? 
* How do we test it, and 
* how do we interpret it? 

Interested statisticians/modellers are invited to contribute to the work, as described in the pdf.
